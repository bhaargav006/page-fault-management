# Page Fault Handling and Management 

## Introduction
This project was done as a part of the OS Course at the University of Minnesota

Paging is a key factor that affects the performance of an application. How efficiently an application gets the data it wants to work on can affect its runtime. With ever-changing requirements of applications and the underlying hardware, custom paging is required to get better throughput out of applications. 

For this project, different paging schemes are implemented which evict using the APIs provided for page creation, page mapping, disk read, disk write, etc. 

## Paging policies implemented :
  1. Random
  2. FIFO
  3. Appromixated LRU
  
## Docs
The policies implemented are compared and contrasted in this experimental study. Please refer documentation for a detailed final report.
